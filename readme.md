#Star wars e-shop

Training project

Creation of an e-shop based on laravel framework

## Install

The install.php file allows you to configure the server used by the app.
Just change the host, login, password and database name parameters in this file, then run
```
php install.php
```

The install.sh file allows you to configure the server step by step by a series of questions.
Here you have to run
```
sh install.sh
```
